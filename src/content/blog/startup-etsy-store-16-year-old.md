### Who are we?
![Mike Baird, Elle Lescher, Ollie Baird](../../pics/mike-elle-ollie.jpg)

#### Crazy Techie Uncle Mike
I love  ***3d printing*** and ***dogs*** and ***startups/entrepreneurship***.  I've started robotics companies, construction companies, and play with tech for fun. One of my hobbies is CAD (Computer Aided Design) modeling and 3d printing a *doggie bag* holder for my dog Ollie (my good boy).  
A random pic of me with some geeky tech:

#### Energetic Neice Elle
My neice (Elle) likes ***e-commerce*** and ***marketing***.  Or maybe I just twisted her arm into starting an Etsy store.  Dunno.
What I do know is all 16 year old's like ***money***.  I may have lured her in with the idea of making a little.   Check out her flossing her swag from Dunkin Donuts (her first job to make money).

### What is the ***Product?***  ... Personalized Doggie Poop Bag Holders
![Geeky Mike and Circuits](../../pics/elle-dunkin_20230902_005108620.jpg)
You heard right, Dog Poop Bag Holders.  Sounds odd, but we think it may work cuz:

1. People ***love their pets***.  Consumer spending on pets outpaces inflation... it even outpaces healthcare cost growth
2. It's ***personalized*** with the owners pet name.  This is not something easily replicated at brick-and-morter pet retailers because it takes hours to 3d print
3. ***It's fun!***  this is the real reason I'm doing this.  We may never sell and single one, but I'll have fun with my neice on the journey
